        Birds are warm-blooded, feathered animals that belong to the class Aves.
They have wings, beaks, and lay hard-shelled eggs, which differentiate them from other animals.
Birds are found all over the world, in nearly every environment, from deserts to rainforests.
They are known for their ability to fly, though some species, like ostriches and penguins, are flightless.
Birds have lightweight skeletons, which aid in flight, and a unique respiratory system for efficient oxygen intake.
Their diet varies, with some being carnivores, others herbivores, and many species omnivores.
, make them a subject of fascination for many.
